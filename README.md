### Week2
After discussion we aim for a baseball game that focus on physics and multi-player(ideally for quest).
No Updates on code yet.
Next week we'll finish proposal, pitch the idea, divide into groups(maybe) and start working on core mechanics. 
Particularly we need to figure out how to project the player's movement into a set of valid moves in-game.
