### Week 1
We spent most of week 1 exploring the various pieces of hardware and software that we have at our disposal. We were able
narrow in on a VR platform after considering the strengths and weaknesses of each of the different headsets. We also learned
about basic software packages used to create content in VR.


### Week 2
After discussion we aim for a baseball game that focus on physics and multi-player(ideally for quest).
No Updates on code yet.
Next week we'll finish proposal, pitch the idea, divide into groups(maybe) and start working on core mechanics. 
Particularly we need to figure out how to project the player's movement into a set of valid moves in-game.

### Week 3
We have structured our ideas into a visible goal and have gotten to work on prototyping. We were able to create a working prototype of bat and ball interactions, creating different trajectories and forces when the ball comes into contact with different areas of the bat.

We also created a path system to control the trajectory of the ball when pitched. We are currently able to emulate a few different standard baseball pitches, and we are looking to get some of the more bizarre ones working by next week.

We have found a good networking code base that looks to be a promising place to start to achieve multiplayer. We are continuing to explore that and have simple multiplayer tests done next week. The most important thing to emphasize for multiplayer is to make sure that the ball moves the same way across all players' views.

Asset Creation is coming along faster than expected. Models for bases and stadium assets have been completed. A texture for the field has been completed using a full physically based shading network. By next week we hope to have a testing stadium environment setup in engine in order to get the right feel for scale. The environment for now may consist of gray models, while textures for them are being produced. The next step is to also start exploring character solutions, and whether or not it is worthwhile to create our own or use the asset store.
