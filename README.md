### Week 1
We spent most of week 1 exploring the various pieces of hardware and software that we have at our disposal. We were able
narrow in on a VR platform after considering the strengths and weaknesses of each of the different headsets. We also learned
about basic software packages used to create content in VR.


### Week 2
After discussion we aim for a baseball game that focus on physics and multi-player(ideally for quest).
No Updates on code yet.
Next week we'll finish proposal, pitch the idea, divide into groups(maybe) and start working on core mechanics. 
Particularly we need to figure out how to project the player's movement into a set of valid moves in-game.
