					<p>This week our team continued working on our networking and new game modes.</p>
					
					<h2 class="section-heading">Zombie Mode</h2>
					<iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/laRYMceBzYY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					
					<p>We created a prototype for our zombie mode using basic capsule colliders as stand-ins for the zombies. Since we are using grenades instead of balls, we have created an area affect explosion to target the zombies. We have stand in explosion effects to simulate this now. Next step will be to put the actual zombie and grenades in and get animations working correctly.</p>
					
					<h2 class="section-heading">Daoyi - Networking</h2>
					
					<p>For next week(s) I would focus on optimizition connection to ensure "quest ready": for example now the priority of physics simulation is given to the Batter side which is extreamly unrealible and sensitive to network flaws. It is also a great idea to sync only on impact/collision points since ball movements are determinent. This will invlove more collabrates with Terrell's works.</p>
					
					<h2 class="section-heading">Terrell and Stephen - Batting Mechanic</h2>
					<p>Early in the week, I worked with Stephen in order to make improvements to the batting mechanics. Previously, the ball would be launched along one of several fixed paths whenever the ball hit the bat, but now the ball can be hit into any direction. To do this, we moved the logic for hitting the ball from the bat to the ball so whenever the ball hits the bat and breaks out of its animation, it also launches itself depending on the angle that it hit the bat at. The speed of the hit is driven by how hard the player swings the bat, but we have a parameter that we can use to adjust the strength of the hit, so we can tweak that value later in order to make it easier or harder to hit homeruns. We also added haptic feedback for when the bat hits the ball. Now the controllers vibrate depending on how hard the hit was.</p>
					
					<h2 class="section-heading">Terrell - Target Practice</h2>
					<p>In preparation for our mid-quarter progress report, I worked on creating the target practice gamemode to show off the improvements that we made to the batting. Since we have already been using a scene with an auto-pitcher and batter for testing batting mechanics, the main task to get this game-mode working was creating targets that disappeared when hit and a way of tracking information about how many targets have been hit. For the targets, I made cylindrical zones outside the field to track where home runs were hit, and used spherical targets for places on and above the field. To visualize the targets, I used cylinders that faded away as they went up away from the ground and a particle system that created a rotating ring around the spherical targets.</p>
					
					
					<h2 class="section-heading">Terrell - Plans for next week</h2>
					<p>We want to work on the zombie game mode next, so I will be helping with that by making it so that balls explode on impact to deal damage to nearby zombies. Also, I want to work on the target practice mode to improve its gameplay elements. Right now everything is fairly basic: none of the targets move, and nothing happens whenever all of them have been hit. To improve this, I can make the targets move across the field, disappear after a set time, and keep track of a score that gets shown at the end of the game. By doing this, we can create a high-score system to give a clear sense of progress and make replaying the gamemode more engaging.</p>
					<p>Additionally, I want to reorganize the pitching system so that it is easier to add new pitches and adjust existing ones, as well as create a new type of pitch. Right now, the spiral ball is the only special pitch, so having either a ball that wiggles around or zig-zags would be interesting.</p>
					
					<h2 class="section-heading">Stephen - Plans for next week</h2>
					<p>Setting up the grey box scene for the zombie mode. Specfically, setting up boxes that represent zombies. Having those zombies move at variable rates of speed torwards the player to try to attack and defeat the player. I will give the zombies an internal life bar that will be depleted by being hit by the bat or getting hit with a grenade. I will be working with Terrell to combine our scenes together into a working game mode. Once the basics of the game mode are complete I will work on making quality of life adjustments.</p>
					
					<h2 class="section-heading">Andrew - Assets</h2>
					<p>This week my focus was on character creation. For multiplayer and single player, we need some form of character to represent the other players and or AI. Because we found our free low poly zombie model on the asset store, I tried to mimic the style of the zombie in order to keep a consistent style.</p>
					<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aW0xCIjpynA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<p>The next step will be to rig and animate the character. The zombie already has a rig set up, so most likely I will just modify the zombie rig for the character. I am going to test Unity's new animation rigging package to create a runtime IK solution for the hands so that we can realistically make the networked player hands move.</p>
					<p>Once the model has been rigged and we've tested, then I will texture it. I'll start with a base texture, but one of our strech goals is to provide character customization. I will probably make additional hair meshes for more gender customization options.</p>
					<p>For our central menu screen, we have also decided create a Locker Room scene where the player will be able to choose different game modes. We are hoping to have a prototype version of that done by the showcase next week.</p>
										
					<h2 class="section-heading">Andrew - Plans for next week</h2>
					<p>Plans for next week are to create a menu to be able to access all of the game modes, which will help make our demo more fluid. I will also rig the character and work with Daoyi to get hands to move correctly over the network. Besides that, I'm going to work on adding in the zombie models and getting their animations synched. I'm also going to finish up the Home Run Derby mode, and explore options for sounds.</p>
					<p>I also plan on finishing updating the blog site. We decided to upgrade because we felt the Jekyll Theme was a little plain. The HTML template is not completely finished, so stay tuned for more updates.</p>
